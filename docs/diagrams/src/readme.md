# Diagram Sources #

Store your plantuml source files in this directory so that, as the architecture evolves,
the diagrams can change and updated renderings can replace previous versions
in ../src and ../out.

## Guidelines ##

* Store your plantuml source code (as .wsd files) in the /docs/diagrams/src directory.
* Store your rendered source code (as .svg images) in the /docs/diagrams/src directory.

* Use lightblue to color elements/microservices that we own and control:
  ex:
  * rethinkdb
  * ledger-sync
  * rbac-server

* Use lightgrey to color elements/microservices that we use but do not control:
  ex:
  * sawtooth
  * the sawtooth validator

* Use stereotypes for <<NEXT>> and <<HYPERLEDGER>> to differentiate between the
  former and latter, respectively.

* Use default colors and no stereotypes for external entities:
  ex:
  * various human users
  * LDAP
  * Azure AD

* Sequences and architecture diagrams should be high level.
  * Only go as deep as individual microservices or modules for sequence and
    architecture diagrams when possible.
  * Source code should be self documenting, docstrings, and general good
    practices will result in self explanatory code. As such high level
    documents should be sufficient.
  * Every major product feature should have a linked sequence diagram.
  * Whenever a PR adds or changes the flow of a feature or data contracts the
    relevant PlantUML diagrams much be updated and re-rendered as an implicit
    success requirement.
